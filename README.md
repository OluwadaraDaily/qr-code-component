## My process

I built it using just HTML and CSS using flexbox on the layout and adding accessibility tags.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned about accessibility of websites using alt texts; tags like main, footer; also using rem, em instead of px for accessibility to those who have bad vision.
